# Prescription-Label-Reading
Prescription Label Reading using deep learning, opencv, OCR.

Support elderly or vulnerable patients should be a focus for many businesses. This is
especially true for those in the health care sector. Enabling voice messages can make it
easier for elderly people to understand your message. Text-to-Speech can provide peace
of mind by empowering you to give better services. For example, you could even send
voice messages that read prescription labels.
This can be a real challenge for anyone with reading difficulties, not to mention the elderly
and visually impaired. A talking label, sent straight to your device, makes it easy to know
everything about your medication. Dosage info can also be tracked and shared with
caregivers.
